2025-08-18 --- Version 1.0.0
    Additions:
     - General B->P FF classes
     - General B->P Prediction classes
     - Added B+->D0 and B0->D+
     - Added B->D BSZ FF (https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00983)
     - Added B->D BLPR FF (arXiv:1703.05330)
     - Added B->D BGL FF
     - Added B->D CLN FF
    Changes:
     - CLN changed to have tensor FFs be zero by default, previous behaviour replicated from flavio
       has been moved to new CLN2 class - should make no difference for SM or NP without tensor contributions
     - Made general FF base clase to take care of setters - reduce redundancy
     - Moved WC and FF setters in predictions to a base observable class that is inherited - reduces redundancy
     - Nomenclature changes, BToDst -> BdToDst, BToD -> BpToD and BdToD
    Fixes:
