2025-11-26 --- Version 1.2.0
    Additions:
     - General classes for some baryonic transitions
     - Added Lb->Lc predictions
     - Lb->Lc DKMR FFs (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.02243)
     - B->V ISGW2 FFs 
     - 1D angular projections in B->V
     - Preliminary fitting framework
     - MC Generator utilities

2025-11-05 --- Version 1.1.1
    Fixes:
     - Fixed inheritance bug in BToV CLN_Hammer

2025-09-12 --- Version 1.1.0
    Additions:
     - Bd->Pi, with BSZ FFs
     - Added direct Hammer equivalent classes for BGL, CLN, BLPR
     - Added comparisons with SL_Decay and Hammer
    Changes:
     - B->P CLN defaults changed to Hammer defaults
    Fixes:

2025-08-18 --- Version 1.0.0
    Additions:
     - General B->P FF classes
     - General B->P Prediction classes
     - Added B+->D0 and B0->D+
     - Added B->D BSZ FF (https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00983)
     - Added B->D BLPR FF (arXiv:1703.05330)
     - Added B->D BGL FF
     - Added B->D CLN FF
    Changes:
     - CLN changed to have tensor FFs be zero by default, previous behaviour replicated from flavio
       has been moved to new CLN2 class - should make no difference for SM or NP without tensor contributions
     - Made general FF base clase to take care of setters - reduce redundancy
     - Moved WC and FF setters in predictions to a base observable class that is inherited - reduces redundancy
     - Nomenclature changes, BToDst -> BdToDst, BToD -> BpToD and BdToD
    Fixes:
