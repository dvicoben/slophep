This is the source code for SL_decay checks (SL_Decay scripts lifted from https://gitlab.cern.ch/scali/SL_Decay, added here for ease of reproducibility). Note that a bug in the BGL outer functions was found and is fixed in the scripts here (See [MR!2](https://gitlab.cern.ch/scali/SL_Decay/-/merge_requests/2)).
